											<a href="#item11">Harmony Lam has been my personal trainer now for the past 4 months and in this time she has totally changed the way I train...</a>
											<p>She has added a new dimension to my training that has reignited my passion for fitness and training.
											Having worked out at the gym for many years, I suddenly found myself in a rut, not getting the results I desired and recovering from an injury. I decided to try a session of personal training with Harmony and from that first session I knew she was the right trainer for me.
											Harmony has pushed me, encouraged me, supported me and always provided sessions that not only get results but inspire me to never give up. Harmony has such an in-depth knowledge of all things to do with health and fitness and no sessions were ever the same. Every session was original, motivating and at times hard work- but I loved it!
											Harmony gave me the encouragement I needed in my training- to try new machines, new strength training exercises, whilst choosing exercises that would support my recovery from injury. The new routines she created added a new dimension to my training and I have gained so much and feel very confident in trying out new training ideas.
											Harmony was exceptionably personable and approachable. I could chat to her freely about anything to do with fitness, nutrition and she helped me sort out those blocks in my life that were stopping me from achieving my goals.
											<br>Harmony’s top qualities and strengths are:
											<br>Developing personal, original, motivating sessions
										    <br>Encouraging and motivating
											<br>Getting the desired results
											<br>Being highly reliable and on time
											<br>Being approachable and getting to know her clients on a personal level
											I have enjoyed my training with Harmony and would encourage anyone who is thinking of how they can improve their training to go for it, you won’t be disappointed!
